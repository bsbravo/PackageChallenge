/**
 * Method {@link #pack(String)} is the entry point method of the challenge and was given from the basic source code.
 * <p>
 * Method {@link DPMaxPackageCostFinder#findSolution(List, int)} is the core method to find best solution given a list
 * of items and the package weight limit. There are comments on that method explaining the approach taken as well the
 * analyse of the time/space complexity of the used algorithm. I believe the rest of the code is pretty much
 * self-explanatory.
 * <p>
 * There is 100% of test coverage by unit tests and all green :)
 * I first started building the unit tests before implementing the solution.
 * The given example in file "Packaging-Challenge.pdf" was one my first test cases.
 * I also built tests to check the enforcement of all the constraints.
 * I've created folder 'test/resources/samples' to add the input files and expected output results for unit tests that
 * compute the solutions.
 * <p>
 * I've followed the Single Responsibility Principle where each class/method is responsible for only one functionality.
 * <p>
 * That's all :) Iâ€™m eager to receive your feedback and I hope I can join Mobiquity team soon.
